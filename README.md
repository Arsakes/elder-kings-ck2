# Elder Kings 


This is the *development version* of Elder Kings, an Elder Scrolls Total Conversion for Crusader Kings 2.

It is set within the Elder Scrolls universe created by Bethesda Softworks and has been in active development since 2012, the same year Crusader Kings II was released. The modification features an entirely new world map covering almost all known and even unknown landmasses of Nirn heavily drawn from both official lore sources and many high quality fan sources.
Almost every single sentient race thus far featured in the Elder Scrolls game is playable with unique, new portrait sets.

# Scope
The aim of the mod is to deliver a great strategy experience to CK2 players set in the world of The Elder Scrolls. Choose any tribal, republic or feudal ruler in the year 2E 450 and guide your dynasty through the turmoil of the Interregnum.
